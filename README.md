Humor Detection in Bengali: Creating and Analyzing Dataset through Social Media in the Bengali Language

The proliferation of online social media has led to a vast amount of user generated content. Social media platforms like Facebook,reddit,x with their character limits, have spawned creative and condensed language to convey messages. This has made the automatic detection of humor a challenging task. Humor detection has been better studied for resource-rich languages given the availability of substantial annotated data. We aim to address this gap by working with Bangla, a low-resource language. We will collect and manually annotate a dataset of Bangla posts, tweets then leveraged this new resource to train and evaluate humor classification models for Bangla social media text.
