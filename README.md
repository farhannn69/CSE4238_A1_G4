Humor Detection in Bengali: Creating and Analyzing Dataset through Social Media in the Bengali Language

The proliferation of online social media has led to a vast amount of user generated content. Social media platforms like Facebook, Reddit, X with their character limits, have spawned creative and condensed language to convey messages. This has made the automatic detection of humor a challenging task. Humor detection has been better studied for resource-rich languages given the availability of substantial annotated data. We aim to address this gap by working with Bengali, a low-resource language. We will collect and manually annotate a dataset of Bengali posts, tweets then leverage this new resource to train and evaluate humor detection models for Bengali social media texts.
